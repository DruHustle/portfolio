## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js 18+ and pnpm
*   Git
*   GitHub account

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DruHustle/portifolio.git
cd portifolio
```

2.  **Install dependencies**

```shell
pnpm install
```

3.  **Start development server**

```shell
pnpm dev
```

4.  **Open in browser** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Build for Production

```shell
pnpm build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/public` directory.

## 📖 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1.  Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2.  Enter repository name: `portifolio`
3.  Choose "Public" (required for free GitHub Pages)
4.  Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

1.  Go to your repository settings
2.  Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
3.  Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
4.  Select branch: **gh-pages** (created by the deployment action)
5.  Select folder: **/(root)**
6.  Click "Save"

### Step 3: Prepare Your Project

1.  **Update package.json** to include the homepage:

```json
{
  "name": "portfolio",
  "homepage": "https://DruHustle.github.io/portifolio",
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

2.  **Install gh-pages package** (if not already installed):

```shell
pnpm add -D gh-pages
```

3.  **Update package.json scripts**:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite --host",
    "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=dist/index.js",
    "predeploy": "pnpm build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",
    "preview": "vite preview --host"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Build and Deploy

1.  **Build the project**:

```shell
pnpm build
```

2.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:

```shell
pnpm deploy
```

This command:

*   Builds your project (via predeploy script)
*   Pushes the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch
*   GitHub Pages automatically serves the content
